### **RISC X86 Translator**
**RISC X86 Translator** is a project entirely implemented in C, demonstrating the smooth conversion of simplified RISC-based 16-bit instructions to x86-64 assembly code. 

### **Features:**
Efficient Conversion: Seamlessly translate RISC-based instructions to x86 assembly code.
User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-use tool for navigating and understanding the translation process.

### **Getting Started:**
Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the documentation to explore RISC X86 Translator and its capabilities.

### **Acknowledgements:**
Special thanks to Dr.Alex Brodsky for the guidance and support throughout the development of Binary X86 Translator.
